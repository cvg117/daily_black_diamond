    <h1>The Daily Black Diamond:<br>
        Bike Transit Dangers in Chicago </h1>
    <h4>

    <p>
        Cities are, by definition, compact human environments. Providing services that are constrained by 
        distance traveled within them is extremely efficient. As we continue to grapple with human-driven climate change, 
        it is essential that we leverage this trait to help individuals and companies reduce their carbon 
        footprints. 
    <br>
    <br>
        To take best advantage, however, requires the means of transit to be efficient. Car centered 
        transportation systems are energy, space, and time inefficient within urban centers. 
        Furthermore, they are dangerous. In such compact living situations, valuing car convenience and access
        devalues not only environmental needs, but human safety. These safety concerns go beyond a barrier to entry for green, 
        human-centered transit methods. They create a transit environment in which the lives of non-drivers are endangered with little recourse. 
        <a href ="https://blockclubchicago.org/2022/11/29/life-and-death-in-chicagos-most-dangerous-bike-lane/">Recent
        investigations</a> into accidents on Milwaukee Avenue cited higher than average hit and run incidents for car-on-bike accidents,
        and vast underreporting/compensation by/for those struck.
    <br>
    <br>
        This series of visualizations sheds light on these dangers. Understanding the extent and location of 
        danger to cyclists and pedestrians reveals the amount of work to be done. Providing better protected 
        lanes, fewer car-legal streets, and more wraparound services for human-driven commuters can
        reduce conjoined harms to our populations and our planet.

            Addressing transit concerns begins at the where. In this case, the literal pain points are easily evident. Former Chicago Mayor
            Rahm Emanuel knew this as well as anyone when he proposed his
            <a href ="https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/cdot/bike/general/ChicagoStreetsforCycling2020.pdf">
             2020 Streets for Cycling Plan</a> in 2012. The city took this effort even further with its 
            <a href = https://visionzerochicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/VZ_HCC_FrameworkPlan_2018-06-15.pdf>Vision Zero Chicago</a> plan to 
            reduce high crash corridors. The outcomes? Unfortunately, failure takes many forms regarding these plans. A lack of concerted funding
            and infrastructural efforts left the city short on the vast majority of its goals. As an example, the 2012 plan promised 100 miles of
            protected bike lanes by 2015. <a href = https://blockclubchicago.org/2021/02/01/chicagos-bike-lane-efforts-have-fallen-short-for-decades-can-lightfoot-help-the-city-catch-up/>
            As of 2021,</a> there were almost 27 miles, accounting for under 10% of the total bike paths in the city.
            Beyond failing to address the most most obviously dangerous zones, these plans were largely 
            <a href =https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/16/us/chicago-bike-plan-accused-of-neighborhood-bias.html>absent any mention</a> of
            the South and West sides. Coupling these facts with the historical disinvestment from those communities and the major discrepancy in 
            collected data of car-on-bike accidents evident in the map above, shows a city transportation apparatus underserving transportation
            equity on a variety of axes.

    <h3>Broken Spokes: Chicago's Most Dangerous Streets</h3>
    <p>
        Source: <a href = "https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-Crashes/85ca-t3if">Chicago Open Data Portal, Traffic Crashes, 2017 - 2022</a>

    <p>
        We know - and have not succeeded in addressing - the where of this issue. Another avenue to progress would be the why. What causes 
        potentially lethal encounters between cars and bicyclists? Can we reduce those causes? In large part, it is no different 
        from the causes of car-on-car accidents. Distracted and dangerous driving in a confined urban environment is a 
        recipe for collision, although, it must be noted that bike behavior regarding traffic control signals is an important contributory factor.
        Unfortunately, the general apathy towards the subject limits our understanding of even these most obvious effects. 
        For every single explained accident on Chicago's most dangerous streets there are .97 accidents with no explanation 
        provided by the reporting officer. This gap in qualitative informaton is exacerbated by massive underreporting caused by a 
        lack of positive civil outcomes for bikers, according to <a href="https://www.bikelaneuprising.com/">bike safety advocates.</a> 
        It will require a concerted data gathering effort to ensure that we address the most critical deficiencies in our current infrastructure.
        Knowing the wheres and whys behind frequent and/or consistently severe crashes will provide opportunities to tailor responses
        efficiently and effectively.

    <h3>Hits or Headers: Comparing Accident Counts to Damage Done</h3>

        Of course, the magnitude of a problem is not the only metric to consider in how it must be dealt with.
        After all, significantly more car-on-car crashes occur throughout a year on Chicago's streets. Where the
        twinned problems diverge is in the severity of these incidents. While car-on-car crashes outnumber
         car-on-human crashes 28-1, the likelihood of serious injury in such accidents in Chicago is vanishingly small.
        The likelihood of severe injury for pedestrians and bikers is 3 to 5 times higher when struck by a vehicle. In short,
        while cars may collide with one another frequently, if our purpose is to keep citizens safe on their daily
        routes it is more impactful to target infrastructure supporting walker and biker safety. 
    <br>
    <br>
        Chicago is known as a geographically large, well-blocked out, and active city. We can take better advantage of
        these qualities to become a safer, greener, healthier city in the future by refocusing our infrastructural efforts
        on non-car transit.

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>
        On a personal level, I was driven to investigate this after I joined the data recently.
        Over the summer, I was involved in an ugly hit and (attempted) run while biking on Clark Street. The confrontation 
        that followed crystallized the need to protect pedestrians and bikers from a transportation culture that sees their 
        safety as incidental to drivers' convenience.
    <br>
    <br>
        Bike accidents are massively underreported in general, and in my case in specific. I am particularly concerned by what the map shows 
        for the south and west sides. It implies that beyond normal standards of underreporting, these areas of the city are being 
        hugely underserved and under supported for bicyclists. I would also be curious to re-do this analysis over a non-covid 
        timeframe when there would be more activity on the streets in general.
    <br>
    <br>
        Two important data aggregation decisions were made to produce this analysis.<br>
        The first is the coding of severity. Injuries were reported by police officers as one of five categories: 
        "Fatal", "Incapacitating", "Non-Incapacitating", "Reported and Not Evident", "None". Each accident could contain
        multiple injuries of varying types. To provide continuous scoring for clearer aggregation, I assigned 
        numerical values ranging from 0 to 1 on increments of 0.25. The resulting severity score is the sum of the weighted values
        of each injury type. For example, a crash that involved four injuries, one of each type would be calculated as follows:
        <br>
        <br>
        Fatal = 1.0 * 1 = 1<br>
        Incapacitating = 0.75 * 1 = 0.75<br>
        Non-Incapacitating = 0.5 * 1 = 0.5<br>
        Reported and Not Evident = 0.25 * 1 = 0.25<br>
        Total = 1 + 0.75 + 0.5 + 0.25 = 2.5
        <br>
        <br>
        It is important to note that these metrics do not capture the vast underreporting of bike-involved accident injuries, nor do they
        reflect injuries caused by the event but discovered after the report was taken.
        <br>
        <br>
        The second is the binning underlying the ring charts. 39 unique report types were provided by reporting officers as to the 
        "primary contributory cause" of the accident. These were split into 3 categories:
        <br>
        <br>
        "Driver Error" - Containing 28 of the 39 report types<br>
        "Environmental" - Containing 9 of the 39 report types<br>
        "Undetermined" - Containing 2 of the 39 report types
        <br>
        <br>   
        The complete breakdown of report type categorization is available in the README accompanying this report.
